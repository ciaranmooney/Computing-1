So far I have really enjoyed listening to the lectures. Richards enthusiasm certainly makes learning more fun. His examples and explainations are really easy to understand.

I particularly enjoyed writing the byte-level programs for the microprocessor (3400x chips), and I'm a little saddened that we have moved onto C more quickly. Ifound that writing with just numbers, a limited number of possible instructions and only a few possible ways to store variables meant that I had to really think about how I was going to solve the problem. 

It was particularly helpful to think out a step-by-step solution first and then try and implement it. Rather than my usual style which is to jump in feet first.

The C coursework that was set I found rather trivial, but a fun way to get started. I may not have stayed within the letter of the rules though.

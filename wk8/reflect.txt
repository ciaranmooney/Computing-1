The fact there were only two assignments this week was a blessing as I was busy with other personal errands. I had to carefully manage my time so that the work got done, but didn't neglect other things. So I a slightly proud of myself. 

I'm also proud of the fact that this time before really starting with the wondrous C assignment I wrote some tests! Then I was quite smug to see that quite a few of my tests were the same as those used by the auto-marker! Maybe my habits are actually changing. 

Glad to be doing more hardcore microprocessor work, but I was displeased with how the task was presented. It was not a very clear set of a requirements for the code. This lead to many comments beneath from people whose code was failing on technicalities. I appreciate these things were mentioned in the lecture, but that is no excuse to be clear in the task descriptions.

Besides that niggling criticism, I really enjoyed it. Reading the suggestions below I used a spreadsheet to actually lay out the code which made it easy to write specific pointers. I actually wrote the task out in steps using notepad first, and then added the required numeric commands that allowed those tasks to be completed. I think I almost wrote my own programming language! It had indented code sub-blocks, named variables and everything! It allowed me to appreciate how C bridges the gap between having the steps of the task and having to do house-keeping (eg, swapping values in and out of frames).

Like Dr. Buckland said at the start of the course. Knowing how to write using microprocessor commands makes my sword more awesome.

Glad to still be sticking at the course especially when I've found it difficult to fit it in. I am really enjoying it still and glad to be learning lots.

Still looking for a junior developer job to start in Autumn this year. So anyone in East Midlands UK wants a keen, ready to learn, bonkers Buckland appreciating employee feel free to send me a message.
